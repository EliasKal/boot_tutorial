# Boot programming tutorial

This is a tutorial for making simple programs that can run directly when booting a computer, with no operating system being loaded. They were made as an attempt to learn how operating systems work, and in particular what happens when the computer is turned on.

There are four parts in the tutorial:

1. Printing a single character on the screen
2. Creating a bootloader so that larger programs can be executed
3. Writing programs in the C programming language
4. Configuring 32-bit mode

The tutorial was written in 2011, so I do not know if some parts of it are outdated. I am uploading it in case it is useful to anyone.
